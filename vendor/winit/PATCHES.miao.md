# Local patches to winit 0.30.13

Only the macOS content view is touched (`src/platform_impl/macos/view.rs`):

1. `mouseDownCanMoveWindow` now returns `false`. With a transparent, full-size
   title bar (`with_titlebar_transparent` + `with_fullsize_content_view`) the
   view is non-opaque, so AppKit's default value for `mouseDownCanMoveWindow`
   is `true`. AppKit then turns a drag in the title strip — including a drag on
   a tab chip — into a system window move, so tab reordering never ran (only the
   right-click *Move Up / Move Down* menu worked), and text selection or sliders
   in that strip fought the window. The host (`mtty-widget`) already moves
   the window itself, per region, via `Window::drag_window` driven by
   `Chrome::on_title_drag_hover`; this patch lets those regions receive the drag.

Symptom without the patch: on macOS, pressing and dragging a tab chip moved the
whole window instead of reordering the tab.
