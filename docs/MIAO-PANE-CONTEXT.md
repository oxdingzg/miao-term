# miao pane Runtime context

`mtty-cli state` accepts `--runtime-context FILE|-` alongside `--session` and
`--cwd`. The JSON value is carried unchanged in the pane's `runtime_context`
state field. Use stdin for local machine paths; never include an administrator
credential, relay token or account password.

An owned Runtime context has `kind: "owned"`, `runtimeID`, and `storage`.
An explicitly attached server has only `kind: "attached"`. JSON `null` clears
the context when the observing client exits. State updates replace the pane's
entry, so missing Session/context fields do not inherit an old client's target.
Different panes retain different contexts even when their Session IDs match.

This is client-reported metadata, not an authorization grant. Desktop Remote
Control must attest the specified local Runtime using miao's private-pipe
bridge, require its observed Runtime ID for mutations, and reject attached,
missing or malformed context. It must never silently select the default local
Runtime. The connection window is separate work tracked in #74.
